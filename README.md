# System Emailer

This library enables services in the Cameron Castle to send emails. It communicates with Mercury,
the email service for other services in the server.  
Eventually, this will be renamed [Talaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talaria) after the winged sandals that enabled Mercury to deliver
messages between the gods and man.
